Simple app mock-up using AngularJS front-end, ASP.NET WebApi2 Back-end and United Bootswatch theme.

Simple one-liner pretty much covers it.

Theme is United from Bootswatch (http://bootswatch.com/united/)

WebApi2 is used for the membership database (live test link will allow anyone to create an account and login)

Product List & Products are tied to static json file that lives on the server.

UI-Router used instead of ngRoute (https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router)

Live test link can be found @ http://umgbeta.azurewebsites.net

That is all for this simple mockup, thanks for checking it out!
